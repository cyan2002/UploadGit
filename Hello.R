#HOW TO PUSH R STUDIO FILE TO GITHUB
#Create a R project with R files in it. You want to create the R project as a version control and input your github repository link
#After that's done you can commit any files in the top right window of R (make sure to add a comment)
#after that enter the code given by Github to allow access to the repository. You'll need an access token (make sure to allow all permissions)
#When that's done your code should be uploaded. After doing the initial steps you can just hit commit, add comment, then push to update code.

#You can either group files by folder or by pushing to branches. 

#I wonder if this updates on Github
